(ns authorization.datom
  "Model values as Datomic transaction data.

  Each entity carries its identity as a real attribute (`:authz.request/id`,
  `:authz.decision/request-id`), declared `:db.unique/identity` in
  `authorization.schema`. `:db/id` holds the same string as a tempid, which is
  what makes the two read together -- but the *attribute* is what survives the
  transaction. A string `:db/id` is scoped to one transaction, so writing a
  request and its decision under the same string only merged them because both
  were written at once; the join is now a reference that says so.

  Two shaping rules apply at this boundary, both so the tx-data a real
  transactor would accept is the tx-data actually emitted:

  - attributes with no value are dropped rather than asserted as nil
  - nested EDN is stored as a `pr-str` blob (`read-blobs` reads it back),
    because no Datomic value type holds a vector of maps"
